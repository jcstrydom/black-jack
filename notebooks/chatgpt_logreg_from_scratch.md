## My prompt:
As a senior data scientist, please explain the process of coding a logistic regression from scratch. 

Take the link function, then apply the loss function (specifically the cross entropy loss), and then explain to me step by step how to write the code to train the model.

## Generation


Sure! Let’s walk through the process of coding a logistic regression model from scratch, step by step. We will cover the following:

1. **Link Function (Sigmoid)**
2. **Loss Function (Cross-Entropy Loss)**
3. **Gradient Descent Algorithm**
4. **Training the Model**

### 1. Link Function (Sigmoid)
The link function for logistic regression is the sigmoid function, which maps any real-valued number into the (0, 1) interval, suitable for binary classification.

The sigmoid function is defined as:
\[ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]

### 2. Loss Function (Cross-Entropy Loss)
The cross-entropy loss (or log loss) for a binary classification problem is defined as:
\[ \text{Loss}(y, \hat{y}) = -\frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \left[ y^{(i)} \log(\hat{y}^{(i)}) + (1 - y^{(i)}) \log(1 - \hat{y}^{(i)}) \right] \]
where \( m \) is the number of training examples, \( y \) is the true label, and \( \hat{y} \) is the predicted probability.

### 3. Gradient Descent Algorithm
To minimize the loss function, we use gradient descent. The gradients of the loss function with respect to the weights \( w \) and bias \( b \) are computed and used to update the parameters iteratively.

The update rules are:
\[ w := w - \alpha \frac{\partial \text{Loss}}{\partial w} \]
\[ b := b - \alpha \frac{\partial \text{Loss}}{\partial b} \]

where \( \alpha \) is the learning rate.

### 4. Training the Model
Let's implement the logistic regression model in Python. We'll go through the steps to initialize parameters, compute predictions, calculate the loss, and update parameters using gradient descent.

Here’s the code:

```python
import numpy as np

class LogisticRegression:
    def __init__(self, learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000):
        self.learning_rate = learning_rate
        self.num_iterations = num_iterations
        self.weights = None
        self.bias = None

    def sigmoid(self, z):
        return 1 / (1 + np.exp(-z))

    def initialize_parameters(self, n_features):
        self.weights = np.zeros(n_features)
        self.bias = 0

    def compute_loss(self, y, y_hat):
        m = y.shape[0]
        loss = -1/m * np.sum(y * np.log(y_hat) + (1 - y) * np.log(1 - y_hat))
        return loss

    def compute_gradients(self, X, y, y_hat):
        m = X.shape[0]
        dw = 1/m * np.dot(X.T, (y_hat - y))
        db = 1/m * np.sum(y_hat - y)
        return dw, db

    def fit(self, X, y):
        n_features = X.shape[1]
        self.initialize_parameters(n_features)
        
        for i in range(self.num_iterations):
            z = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
            y_hat = self.sigmoid(z)
            loss = self.compute_loss(y, y_hat)
            
            dw, db = self.compute_gradients(X, y, y_hat)
            
            self.weights -= self.learning_rate * dw
            self.bias -= self.learning_rate * db
            
            if i % 100 == 0:
                print(f'Loss after iteration {i}: {loss:.4f}')
    
    def predict(self, X):
        z = np.dot(X, self.weights) + self.bias
        y_hat = self.sigmoid(z)
        y_pred = [1 if i > 0.5 else 0 for i in y_hat]
        return np.array(y_pred)

# Example usage:
# X_train, y_train are the training data features and labels respectively
# X_train = np.array([[feature1, feature2], ...])
# y_train = np.array([label1, label2, ...])

# model = LogisticRegression(learning_rate=0.01, num_iterations=1000)
# model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `__init__`: Initializes the model with a learning rate and number of iterations.
   - `initialize_parameters`: Initializes the weights to zeros and the bias to zero.

2. **Sigmoid Function**:
   - `sigmoid`: Computes the sigmoid function for the input z.

3. **Loss Computation**:
   - `compute_loss`: Computes the cross-entropy loss.

4. **Gradient Computation**:
   - `compute_gradients`: Computes the gradients of the loss with respect to the weights and bias.

5. **Training (Fit)**:
   - `fit`: Runs gradient descent to update weights and bias. Prints the loss every 100 iterations.

6. **Prediction**:
   - `predict`: Uses the trained weights and bias to make predictions on new data.

This implementation provides a clear understanding of how logistic regression works from a fundamental perspective.
